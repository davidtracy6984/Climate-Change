A strong southerly return flow commenced out ahead of the trough during the 8th-9th, allowing for unseasonably warm and humid conditions to advance northward across Southern Oklahoma, much of Central and Eastern Texas, as well as Louisiana, Arkansas, and the Lower Mississippi Valley. Meanwhile, an intensifying surface low pressure system and associated dry line developed along the Red River of North Texas into Southern Oklahoma during the afternoon hours, which spread east northeast across the Ark-La-Tex during the early morning hours on January 11th. With afternoon temperatures climbing into the mid 70s ahead of this trough, moderate instability developed across the broad warm sector, with very strong wind shear in place as large scale forcing increased ahead of the trough axis across East Texas, Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, and North Louisiana. Thus, an axis of strong to severe showers and thunderstorms developed during the evening hours across Southeast Oklahoma, adjacent sections of Southwest Arkansas and East Texas, which advanced east into North Louisiana during the early morning hours of the 11th. Widespread damaging winds downed trees and power lines across much of Northwest and Northcentral Louisiana, with even a long track tornado developing along the line of severe thunderstorms across Central Bossier, Southern Webster, and Southern Claiborne Parishes. Another isolated tornado touched down in Western Union Parish, before these storms exited the region shortly before daybreak on the 11th. Unfortunately, these storms resulted in four fatalities  across Northwest Louisiana, three of which occurred from the Haughton tornado.","Trees were downed across Ranchette Road in Stonewall.","CSV"

Impacts were limited to elevated roadways and higher terrain passes. Strong west winds then developed in the wake of this system as it shifted in the Great Plains. Wind gusts of 50 to 65 mph were common over the northern high terrain, the east slopes of the central mountain chain, and parts of northeaster New Mexico.","SNOTELs in the northern Sangre de Cristo Mountains generally received about 6 inches of snow.

This signature was characterized by a relative minimum in correlation coefficient per KAMX radar data, and corresponded with an embedded inflection in the zone of enhanced |reflectivity accompanying the QLCS that also aligned with a well-defined mesovortex. This TDS occurred over the Everglades, and was used as the foundation for this tornado report. ||The lack of conclusively surveyed damage indicators precludes the delineation |of an exact damage rating. As a result, an unknown rating has been assigned to this tornado.

This tornado continued on the ground intermittently east-northeast throughout Southern Claiborne Parish, snapping and uprooting numerous trees as it crossed Harris Road, Old Arcadia Road, Faulk Road, Sherrill Road, and Highway 154 south of Athens. The tornado produced partial roof damage to approximately a half dozen chicken houses and shingle and partial roof damage to several other structures, especially off of Buckner Road, Cook Road, and Highway 519 before finally lifting. In addition, widespread straight line winds estimated at 90-100 mph along the path of the tornado led to extensive tree damage. Estimated maximum winds from this tornado throughout Southern Claiborne Parish ranged from 90-105 mph, consistent with an EF-1 tornado but weaker than the estimated maximum winds near 135 mph that was surveyed in Eastern Bossier Parish. The total track length of this tornado when it initially touched down in Central Bossier Parish to when it lifted in Southern Claiborne Parish was just under 41 miles.","CSV"

The storm started Friday morning, January 17th with a surge of initial deep moisture advecting northward across the Upper Midwest. A dry layer at mid-levels kept the snowfall across southwest, and south central Minnesota before this layer saturated by noon. There was a 3 to 5 hour period of heavy snowfall that produced snowfall rates of 1 inch per hour. A few areas in southwest Minnesota had already received 4 to 6 inches of snow before noon. This area of snow moved northeast and caused heavy snow bands across east central and central Minnesota, as well as west central Wisconsin by the afternoon. As quickly as the snow started, it ended by the late afternoon, and early evening as a dry slot at mid-levels cutoff any ice crystal producing clouds. This dry slot, and the accompany freezing drizzle once the snow ended, caused a layer of ice to form on the snow that fell earlier.||By sunrise, ice crystal producing clouds spread across the Upper Midwest as the main upper storm moved across the area. Periods of light snow fell across the region, but most of the accumulating snowfall had ended. The cold front moved across Minnesota, and into western Wisconsin by noon. Temperatures fell 10 to 20 degrees behind this front along with strong gusty winds developing. These winds created significant blowing and drifting snow in western Wisconsin, especially in open country. The winds slowly abated during the evening, but blowing snow continued.||A strong arctic cold front moved across Minnesota from before sunrise in the far west, to eastern Minnesota by late morning. The front was accompany by light to moderate snow which produced whiteout conditions for an hour.","Snowfall rates of 1/2 inch per hour occurred during the morning and afternoon of Friday, January 17th. Gusty winds accompany the snowfall and continued through the storm. Locally 5 to 6 inches of snow fell on Friday, and early Saturday.

The storm started Friday morning, January 17th with a surge of initial deep moisture advecting northward across the Upper Midwest. A dry layer at mid-levels kept the snowfall across southwest, and south central Minnesota before this layer saturated by noon. There was a 3 to 5 hour period of heavy snowfall that produced snowfall rates of 1 inch per hour. A few areas in southwest Minnesota had already received 4 to 6 inches of snow before noon. This area of snow moved northeast and caused heavy snow bands across east central and central Minnesota, as well as west central Wisconsin by the afternoon. As quickly as the snow started, it ended by the late afternoon, and early evening as a dry slot at mid-levels cutoff any ice crystal producing clouds. This dry slot, and the accompany freezing drizzle once the snow ended, caused a layer of ice to form on the snow that fell earlier.||By sunrise, ice crystal producing clouds spread across the Upper Midwest as the main upper storm moved across the area. Periods of light snow fell across the region, but most of the accumulating snowfall had ended. The cold front moved across Minnesota, and into western Wisconsin by noon.

Five electrical power poles were downed along Highway 144, as well as another trailer getting rolled to near the bottom of Lake Chicot.  The tornado continued to snap large limbs and uproot hardwood trees as it moved across Pecan Ridge Drive. The tornado continued to just north of Levee Road where it lifted, but not before a few uprooting hardwood trees and snapping small to medium sized limbs. It is important to note that a large swath of severe wind speeds resulted in widespread downed trees on Lakehall Road, Sunnyside Road, Stuart Island Road and at the Lake Chicot State Park. Several of these trees fell on power lines causing outages to a large portion of the Lake Village community. This tornado then continued east-northeast across the MS River to across Lake Ferguson in|Washington County, where the second floor was blown off of a lake house on South Ferguson Road. In addition, a high concentration of snapped and uprooted hardwood trees was noted on the backside of the lakehouse on South Ferguson Road, thus resulting in the upgraded EF-2 rating. It continued to move east to Highway 1 North|where it snapped small to large hardwood tree limbs before dissipating. Estimated peak wind with this tornado was 127 mph.","CSV"

There was a 3 to 5 hour period of heavy snowfall that produced snowfall rates of 1 inch per hour. A few areas in southwest Minnesota had already received 4 to 6 inches of snow before noon. This area of snow moved northeast and caused heavy snow bands across east central and central Minnesota, as well as west central Wisconsin by the afternoon. As quickly as the snow started, it ended by the late afternoon, and early evening as a dry slot at mid-levels cutoff any ice crystal producing clouds. This dry slot, and the accompany freezing drizzle once the snow ended, caused a layer of ice to form on the snow that fell earlier.||By sunrise, ice crystal producing clouds spread across the Upper Midwest as the main upper storm moved across the area. Periods of light snow fell across the region, but most of the accumulating snowfall had ended. The cold front moved across Minnesota, and into western Wisconsin by noon. Temperatures fell 10 to 20 degrees behind this front along with strong gusty winds developing. These winds created significant blowing and drifting snow in western Wisconsin, especially in open country. The winds slowly abated during the evening, but blowing snow continued.||A strong arctic cold front moved across Minnesota from before sunrise in the far west, to eastern Minnesota by late morning. The front was accompany by light to moderate snow which produced whiteout conditions for an hour.","Several wind sensors, web cams, and trained observers, indicated that significant blowing snow started with the arrival of the cold frontal passage. By mid-morning, wind speeds increased to 25 to 40 mph, with gusts up to 45 mph. Although wind speeds increased before sunrise, surface visibility did not drop consistently to less than 1 mile under late morning. However, whiteout conditions were observed in parts of the county, during the afternoon.","CSV"

Early morning temperatures were in the upper 60s and lower 70s with dewpoints in the upper 60s. This aided in the development of uncapped surface-based instability that was more than sufficient to maintain the QLCS. A strengthening  shortwave trough was lifting northeastward across the Ozarks during the event resulting in strengthing wind fields and ample wind shear.

A strong southerly return flow commenced out ahead of the trough during the 8th-9th, allowing for unseasonably warm and humid conditions to advance northward across Southern Oklahoma, much of Central and Eastern Texas, as well as Louisiana, Arkansas, and the Lower Mississippi Valley. Meanwhile, an intensifying surface low pressure system and associated dry line developed along the Red River of North Texas into Southern Oklahoma during the afternoon hours, which spread east northeast across the Ark-La-Tex during the early morning hours on January 11th. With afternoon temperatures climbing into the mid 70s ahead of this trough, moderate instability developed across the broad warm sector, with very strong wind shear in place as large scale forcing increased ahead of the trough axis across East Texas, Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, and North Louisiana. Thus, an axis of strong to severe showers and thunderstorms developed during the evening hours across Southeast Oklahoma, adjacent sections of Southwest Arkansas and East Texas, which advanced east into North Louisiana during the early morning hours of the 11th. Widespread damaging winds downed trees and power lines across much of Northwest and Northcentral Louisiana, with even a long track tornado developing along the line of severe thunderstorms across Central Bossier, Southern Webster, and Southern Claiborne Parishes. Another isolated tornado touched down in Western Union Parish, before these storms exited the region shortly before daybreak on the 11th.

The storm started Friday morning, January 17th with a surge of initial deep moisture advecting northward across the Upper Midwest. A dry layer at mid-levels kept the snowfall across southwest, and south central Minnesota before this layer saturated by noon. There was a 3 to 5 hour period of heavy snowfall that produced snowfall rates of 1 inch per hour. A few areas in southwest Minnesota had already received 4 to 6 inches of snow before noon. This area of snow moved northeast and caused heavy snow bands across east central and central Minnesota, as well as west central Wisconsin by the afternoon. As quickly as the snow started, it ended by the late afternoon, and early evening as a dry slot at mid-levels cutoff any ice crystal producing clouds. This dry slot, and the accompany freezing drizzle once the snow ended, caused a layer of ice to form on the snow that fell earlier.||By sunrise, ice crystal producing clouds spread across the Upper Midwest as the main upper storm moved across the area. Periods of light snow fell across the region, but most of the accumulating snowfall had ended. The cold front moved across Minnesota, and into western Wisconsin by noon. Temperatures fell 10 to 20 degrees behind this front along with strong gusty winds developing. These winds created significant blowing and drifting snow in western Wisconsin, especially in open country. The winds slowly abated during the evening, but blowing snow continued.||A strong arctic cold front moved across Minnesota from before sunrise in the far west, to eastern Minnesota by late morning.

The storm started Friday morning, January 17th with a surge of initial deep moisture advecting northward across the Upper Midwest. A dry layer at mid-levels kept the snowfall across southwest, and south central Minnesota before this layer saturated by noon. There was a 3 to 5 hour period of heavy snowfall that produced snowfall rates of 1 inch per hour. A few areas in southwest Minnesota had already received 4 to 6 inches of snow before noon. This area of snow moved northeast and caused heavy snow bands across east central and central Minnesota, as well as west central Wisconsin by the afternoon. As quickly as the snow started, it ended by the late afternoon, and early evening as a dry slot at mid-levels cutoff any ice crystal producing clouds. This dry slot, and the accompany freezing drizzle once the snow ended, caused a layer of ice to form on the snow that fell earlier.||By sunrise, ice crystal producing clouds spread across the Upper Midwest as the main upper storm moved across the area. Periods of light snow fell across the region, but most of the accumulating snowfall had ended. The cold front moved across Minnesota, and into western Wisconsin by noon. Temperatures fell 10 to 20 degrees behind this front along with strong gusty winds developing. These winds created significant blowing and drifting snow in western Wisconsin, especially in open country. The winds slowly abated during the evening, but blowing snow continued.||A strong arctic cold front moved across Minnesota from before sunrise in the far west, to eastern Minnesota by late morning. The front was accompany by light to moderate snow which produced whiteout conditions for an hour.","Snowfall rates of 1/2 inch per hour occurred during the morning of Friday, January 17th. Gusty winds accompany the snowfall and continued through the storm. Locally 5 to 6 inches of snow fell on Friday, and early Saturday, with some freezing drizzle during the afternoon and evening. Blizzard conditions were met on Saturday due to strong winds and blowing snow.","CSV"

A reinforcement of colder, drier air backdoored southwest into Southeast Oklahoma and Southwest Arkansas during the overnight hours and early morning hours on January 20th-21st, and lingered throughout the daytime hours into the overnight/early morning hours of January 22nd. However, the upper flow transitioned to southwest during this time ahead of a shortwave trough over Eastern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle, which shifted east across the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley during the early morning hours on the 22nd. Large scale forcing ahead of this trough contributed to areas of light precipitation developing over the Ark-La-Tex region, with the dry air mass having to saturate from the top down, contributing to a sleet and snow mix falling across portions of extreme Northeast Texas, Southeast Oklahoma, and the northern sections of Southwest Arkansas. Given the fact that temperatures fell slightly below freezing at the onset of the precipitation, light accumulations of sleet and snow were reported across the northern sections of Northeast Texas, generally along and northeast of an Avery, to Dekalb and Atlanta line, with amounts ranging from 0.2-0.3 inches. This did result in some patchy ice developing on some of the area roadways and bridges during the early morning, before temperatures climbed back above freezing by mid morning. ||The following are snow and sleet reports from various locations across Northeast Texas from the morning of January 22nd: In Avery (Eastern Red River County), 0.3 inches of snow was recorded, on the Texas side of Texarkana (Eastern Bowie County), 0.2 inches of sleet was recorded, and in Atlanta (Eastern Cass County), 0.2 inches of sleet was recorded.","","CSV"

This dry slot, and the accompany freezing drizzle once the snow ended, caused a layer of ice to form on the snow that fell earlier.||By sunrise, ice crystal producing clouds spread across the Upper Midwest as the main upper storm moved across the area. Periods of light snow fell across the region, but most of the accumulating snowfall had ended. The cold front moved across Minnesota, and into western Wisconsin by noon. Temperatures fell 10 to 20 degrees behind this front along with strong gusty winds developing. These winds created significant blowing and drifting snow in western Wisconsin, especially in open country. The winds slowly abated during the evening, but blowing snow continued.||A strong arctic cold front moved across Minnesota from before sunrise in the far west, to eastern Minnesota by late morning. The front was accompany by light to moderate snow which produced whiteout conditions for an hour.","Snowfall rates of 1/2 inch per hour occurred during the afternoon of Friday, January 17th. Gusty winds accompany the snowfall and continued through the storm. Freezing drizzle also occurred Friday night. Some ice accumulated on top of the snow. Locally 5 to 6 inches of snow fell on Friday, and early Saturday. Significant blowing and drifting snow occurred on Saturday, especially in open country.","CSV"

There was a 3 to 5 hour period of heavy snowfall that produced snowfall rates of 1 inch per hour. A few areas in southwest Minnesota had already received 4 to 6 inches of snow before noon. This area of snow moved northeast and caused heavy snow bands across east central and central Minnesota, as well as west central Wisconsin by the afternoon. As quickly as the snow started, it ended by the late afternoon, and early evening as a dry slot at mid-levels cutoff any ice crystal producing clouds. This dry slot, and the accompany freezing drizzle once the snow ended, caused a layer of ice to form on the snow that fell earlier.||By sunrise, ice crystal producing clouds spread across the Upper Midwest as the main upper storm moved across the area. Periods of light snow fell across the region, but most of the accumulating snowfall had ended. The cold front moved across Minnesota, and into western Wisconsin by noon. Temperatures fell 10 to 20 degrees behind this front along with strong gusty winds developing. These winds created significant blowing and drifting snow in western Wisconsin, especially in open country. The winds slowly abated during the evening, but blowing snow continued.||A strong arctic cold front moved across Minnesota from before sunrise in the far west, to eastern Minnesota by late morning. The front was accompany by light to moderate snow which produced whiteout conditions for an hour.","Snowfall rates of 1/2 inch per hour occurred during the late afternoon and evening of Friday, January 17th. Gusty winds accompany the snowfall and continued through the storm. Freezing drizzle also occurred Friday night. Some ice accumulated on top of the snow. Locally 5 to 6 inches of snow fell on Friday, and early Saturday. Significant blowing and drifting snow occurred on Saturday, especially in open country.","CSV"

The tornado cut through a few neighborhoods on the south side of Center, where numerous trees were snapped or uprooted across the path through the town, resulting in roof and structural damage to many homes as trees fell through them. The most extensive damage occurred in the Lakewood subdivision just off of Highway 7, where one minor injury occurred as a fallen pine tree heavily damaged the roof of a home. In addition, a handful of other homes farther east along Ballard Street sustained significant damage from falling trees. There was also damage to homes farther east near Martin Luther King Drive, where a few homes sustained minor structural roof damage due to winds alone. On Loop 500 East on the southeast side of town, there was additional structural damage due to mainly wind, although a few of the damaged homes were likely vacant and already in a heavy state of disrepair before the tornado. It then continued into much more rural areas on the eastern outskirts of Center, resulting in scattered tree and very low-end structural damage until reaching County Road 3047. Here, a majority of the chicken houses had some of their roof paneling removed with a few of the houses having most of the roof paneling torn off along with additional structural damage. It was at this point where the most concentrated damage was found. The tornado then lifted shortly after crossing County Road 3047.","CSV"

Just east of Ashley 912 Road, one wooden high tension segment had the top broken out. In the Snyder community, some homes sustained roof damage and had trees down on them. North of Highway 82, near Horseshoe Lake, a lot of hardwood trees were heavily damaged and there were three segments of the wooden high tension poles and lines taken out. The tornado continued roughly along Highway 82 toward Montrose. The strongest core of the tornado remained north of the highway and downed two more wooden high tension segments before Montrose and two more just north of town to the west of Highway 165. In the town of Montrose, numerous trees were damaged along with many homes having some degree of roof damage or a handful more with a tree on the home. Just east of Montrose, near the Chicot County line and north of Highway 82, a metal high tension pole segment was taken down which supported the highest wind estimate of 130 mph.

The convection maintained intensity after it crossed the Mississippi River during the early morning hours. Tremendous wind shear (winds of 50 knots down to 1500 feet above ground level) and strong forcing associated with a potent 500 mb shortwave compensated for weak instability. Some of the strong low-level winds reached the surface in the form of gradient wind gusts to around 40 mph.

Severe weather occurred in the early morning hours of January 11th and continued across the ArkLaMiss region before noon, resulting in widespread wind damage as well as some tornadoes.","This tornado started just northeast of Hamburg along Ashley 70 Road and tracked roughly 20 miles to just east of Montrose in Chicot County. Thousands of trees were uprooted and snapped along the path along with numerous power lines and poles downed. Some of the heaviest damage was to a mobile home just off Ashley 129 Road. The home was thrown 15 to 20 feet and destroyed. Another mobile home was destroyed along Ashley 128 Road. The tornado then crossed Highway 82 near Ashley 301 Road. Power poles were broken here and a tractor shed was heavily damaged. From this point, the tornado mostly paralleled Highway 82 or tracked along it. Many power lines were down along with poles. Just east of Ashley 912 Road, one wooden high tension segment had the top broken out. In the Snyder community, some homes sustained roof damage and had trees down on them. North of Highway 82, near Horseshoe Lake, a lot of hardwood trees were heavily damaged and there were three segments of the wooden high tension poles and lines taken out. The tornado continued roughly along Highway 82 toward Montrose. The strongest core of the tornado remained north of the highway and downed two more wooden high tension segments before Montrose and two more just north of town to the west of Highway 165. In the town of Montrose, numerous trees were damaged along with many homes having some degree of roof damage or a handful more with a tree on the home. Just east of Montrose, near the Chicot County line and north of Highway 82, a metal high tension pole segment was taken down which supported the highest wind estimate of 130 mph. The tornado dissipated near County Road 293 on the north side of Highway 82. Maximum width was 1000 yards in Ashley County. Total path length was 20.51 miles. Maximum estimated winds in Chicot County were 88 mph, but 130 mph winds were estimated in Ashley County.","CSV"

As the cold air deepened and the cap rose to nearly 10,000 feet, multiple bands of moderate to occasionally heavy lake snow became established east of the lakes. Selected snow totals included 19 in Osceola, 12 in Redfield, 21.5 in Java Village, 23 in Wyoming, 20.9 in Perrysburg, 8.9 in Watertown, and 13 in Forestville. As the cold front passed that brought colder air in, a seiche on Lake Erie again brought lakeshore flooding to Chautauqua and Erie counties, doing further damage to the Dunkirk Pier, Buffalo break wall, and closing Route 5 in Hamburg. There were two distinct pulses of higher water on the east end of the lake, as well. The first corresponded with lake levels of 8.18 feet above low water datum, and the second of 7.3 feet above low water datum.","","CSV"

Heavy rainfall, flooding, isolated damaging winds, a brief tornado, and gusty non-thunderstorm winds impacted southern Illinois during this time. The bulk of the event occurred overnight and into the morning hours on the 11th. Rainfall totals ranged from 2 to 5 inches, which resulted in widespread areal flooding and isolated flash flooding across the region. Smaller rivers such as the Little Wabash and the Skillet Fork went into moderate to major flooding. Strong to severe convection over the Ozark Mountains moved east into an environment of very strong wind shear over southeast Missouri, with 850 mb winds near 60 knots. Tremendous wind shear (winds of 50 knots down to 1500 feet above ground level) and strong forcing associated with a potent 500 mb shortwave compensated for weak instability. The convection weakened after it crossed the Mississippi River during the early morning hours. Some of the strong winds aloft reached the surface as gradient gusts from 40 to 49 mph, mainly along and south of a Carbondale to Harrisburg line.

A strong southerly return flow commenced out ahead of the trough during the 8th-9th, allowing for unseasonably warm and humid conditions to advance northward across Southern Oklahoma, much of Central and Eastern Texas, as well as Louisiana, Arkansas, and the Lower Mississippi Valley. Meanwhile, an intensifying surface low pressure system and associated dry line developed along the Red River of North Texas into Southern Oklahoma during the afternoon hours, which spread east northeast across the Ark-La-Tex during the early morning hours on January 11th. With afternoon temperatures climbing into the mid 70s ahead of this trough, moderate instability developed across the broad warm sector, with very strong wind shear in place as large scale forcing increased ahead of the trough axis across East Texas, Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, and North Louisiana. Thus, an axis of strong to severe showers and thunderstorms developed during the evening hours across Southeast Oklahoma, adjacent sections of Southwest Arkansas and East Texas, which advanced east into North Louisiana during the early morning hours of the 11th. Damaging winds downed trees and power lines across portions of East Texas, with even multiple tornadoes touching down along the line of severe thunderstorms. Unfortunately, a man  was killed when a tornado touched down west of Nacogdoches and a tree fell on his mobile home. These storms also produced locally heavy rainfall, with amounts of one to three inches, with isolated higher amounts up to four inches recorded across much of this area, resulting in isolated instances of flash flooding. These storms continued to intensify during the late evening and early morning hours as they moved into extreme Eastern Texas and Western Louisiana, producing more in the way of widespread wind damage and isolated tornadoes.","An EF-1 tornado with estimated maximum winds near 100 mph touched down along County Road 723 just south of Farm to Market Road 225, where it snapped several large branches in a field of trees. The tornado tracked east-northeast where it crossed Farm to Market Road 225 and paralleled the north side of the roadway. It snapped and uprooted numerous trees and broke several more large branches as it continued east-northeast. The tornado downed a large tree onto a mobile home along Sweat Circle, a private road off of Farm to Market Road 225, where a 44 year old male was killed and one minor injury was reported. The tornado then crossed County Road 722 and Russelville Road where it resulted in additional tree damage and minor damage to homes. The tornado continued northeast where it crossed County Road 719 and several private properties, damaging a few more trees before lifting near Floyd Harvin Road.","CSV"

Widespread damaging winds downed trees and power lines across much of Northwest and Northcentral Louisiana, with even a long track tornado developing along the line of severe thunderstorms across Central Bossier, Southern Webster, and Southern Claiborne Parishes. Another isolated tornado touched down in Western Union Parish, before these storms exited the region shortly before daybreak on the 11th.

A strong southerly return flow commenced out ahead of the trough during the 8th-9th, allowing for unseasonably warm and humid conditions to advance northward across Southern Oklahoma, much of Central and Eastern Texas, as well as Louisiana, Arkansas, and the Lower Mississippi Valley. Meanwhile, an intensifying surface low pressure system and associated dry line developed along the Red River of North Texas into Southern Oklahoma during the afternoon hours, which spread east northeast across the Ark-La-Tex during the early morning hours on January 11th. With afternoon temperatures climbing into the mid 70s ahead of this trough, moderate instability developed across the broad warm sector, with very strong wind shear in place as large scale forcing increased ahead of the trough axis across East Texas, Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, and North Louisiana. Thus, an axis of strong to severe showers and thunderstorms developed during the evening hours across Southeast Oklahoma, adjacent sections of Southwest Arkansas and East Texas, which advanced east into North Louisiana during the early morning hours of the 11th. Widespread damaging winds downed trees and power lines across much of Northwest and Northcentral Louisiana, with even a long track tornado developing along the line of severe thunderstorms across Central Bossier, Southern Webster, and Southern Claiborne Parishes. Another isolated tornado touched down in Western Union Parish, before these storms exited the region shortly before daybreak on the 11th. Unfortunately, these storms resulted in four fatalities  across Northwest Louisiana, three of which occurred from the Haughton tornado.","This is the continuation of the Bossier Parish EF-2 tornado. This tornado weakened slightly as it crossed Pilgrim Rest Road, and tracked northeast before entering the southern sections of Doyline, downing hundreds of trees as it crossed Highways 163 and 164, before entering the extreme southeast corner of Camp Minden. The tornado then tore through the town of Sibley and the northern fringes of Dubberly, where it downed trees and power lines, damaged a metal barn, the roof of a home, and destroyed a shed on Wallraven Road. An 18-wheeler trailer was overturned at the South Webster Industrial Park in Sibley, and a building, fencing, and equipment were damaged at an oil field service company at the park. Just before the tornado crossed Interstate 20 between exits 49 and 52, it developed a much wider swath of damaging straight line winds with its rear flank downdraft near and just south of the tornado track. In fact, a large sign was blown over onto an 18-wheeler at Love's Truckstop at I-20 Exit 49 (Highway 531). After it crossed Interstate 20 southeast of Minden, the tornado then rolled a single-wide mobile home on Fuller Cemetery Road near the Nine Forks community and damaged the roofs of two structures before it moved into Southwest Claiborne Parish. The tornadic winds as it tracked through Southern Webster Parish did weaken slightly from its estimated maximum winds in Eastern Bossier Parish, and ranged from 95-110 mph, which is in the EF-1 range. At least 120 broken power poles and over 250 spans of downed wire were the result of this tornado and associated  widespread damaging winds near Doyline, Sibley, Dubberly, and Minden. Significant damage was done to the major power distribution lines that feed the town of Sibley and the South Webster Industrial District.","CSV"

The most concentrated area of damage was located at 595 Charlie Norris Rd, where several large barns, a greenhouse, and the top of a silo all experienced major structural damage. All of the barn and silo damage was moved from the SW to the NNE at a distance of up to half a mile. The medium sized greenhouse had its entire roof structure destroyed. A single-wide mobile home was turned and rolled once or twice, with three people inside. The three people all sustained bruises and cuts, with the most significant being a female who was thrown into a fish tank and had to go the hospital. An old farmhouse adjacent to the mobile home sustained major roof damage as well. All across the property, there were uprooted and snapped trees. Across the street, on the west side of the road, a medium sized barn was completely destroyed.At 645 Charlie Norris Rd, there was extensive tree damage, especially cedar trees, along with outbuildings and barns. The home owner had recently built a new fence with posts in concrete, and some of these posts were leaning or lifted out of the ground. The owner was putting away a small John Deere tractor about a minute before the storm struck and the winds were so strong, it lifted the tractor almost a foot off the ground and rotated it approximately 60 degrees. A smaller house on the property experienced damage on the front porch, which had its foundation lifted, damaging the roof and gutter. The emergency manager in Clark County KY reported sporadic wind damage across the county, mainly in the form of tree damage. One of the most concentrated areas of damage was 470 Ford Hampton Rd in Winchester.","CSV"

Ample wind energy also was present, which not only helped bring damaging winds with severe storms but also allowed for strong gradient winds to occur ahead of an eastward advancing squall line. Severe weather occurred in the early morning hours of January 11th and continued across the ArkLaMiss region before noon, resulting in widespread wind damage as well as some tornadoes.","This tornado began on the southeast side of the Lake Village Municipal Airport on Airport Road where it rolled and almost destroyed a manufactured home. It is at Airport Road where one injury was reported due to a tree falling on a home. It then moved east-northeast to US Highway 278, breaking 8 to 10 wooden electrical poles. It moved to the northeast of the Lake Village community where it continued to knock down wooden electrical poles and began to uproot and snap large branches from softwood|trees along North Lakeshore Drive and along the shore of Lake Chicot. The Lake Village Country Club along North Lakeshore Drive took damage to its roof on the backside. In addition, on the backside of the Country Club, a nearby forested area had multiple|snapped large hardwood tree limbs in addition to the tin roof of a metal storage building peeled completely off. Also along North Lakeshore Drive, multiple trees were uprooted and snapped at a trailer park, where one trailer was blown across the street to near the bottom of Lake Chicot. As the tornado continued to track northeast, it moved along AR Highway 144, uprooting trees and snapping large hardwood limbs. Five electrical power poles were downed along Highway 144, as well as another trailer getting rolled to near the bottom of Lake Chicot.  The tornado continued to snap large limbs and uproot hardwood trees as it moved across Pecan Ridge Drive. The tornado continued to just north of Levee Road where it lifted, but not before a few uprooting hardwood trees and snapping small to medium sized limbs. It is important to note that a large swath of severe wind speeds resulted in widespread downed trees on Lakehall Road, Sunnyside Road, Stuart Island Road and at the Lake Chicot State Park. Several of these trees fell on power lines causing outages to a large portion of the Lake Village community. This tornado then continued east-northeast across the MS River to across Lake Ferguson in|Washington County, where the second floor was blown off of a lake house on South Ferguson Road. In addition, a high concentration of snapped and uprooted hardwood trees was noted on the backside of the lakehouse on South Ferguson Road, thus resulting in the upgraded EF-2 rating. It continued to move east to Highway 1 North|where it snapped small to large hardwood tree limbs before dissipating. Estimated peak wind with this tornado was 127 mph.","CSV"

Moisture levels were on the rise ahead of the system. It was a perfect setup for severe weather and flash flooding.||By late afternoon and into the overnight hours/early on the 11th, a massive damaging wind episode unfolded. Wind gusts from 60 to 90 mph pounded parts of the state. Trees and/or power lines were downed at Yellville (Marion County), Henderson (Baxter County), Elizabeth (Fulton County), Melbourne (Izard County), Leslie (Searcy County), a few miles west of Arkadelphia (Clark County), Malvern (Hot Spring County), Judsonia (White County), Fordyce (Dallas County), Pine Bluff (Jefferson County), Cotton Plant (Woodruff County), Monticello (Drew County), St. Charles (Arkansas County), and Watson (Desha County). Some fallen trees landed on homes. Wind recording equipment measured a 74 mph gust at Fargo (Monroe County), and a 71 mph gust at the University of Arkansas at Monticello (Drew County).||There were also isolated tornadoes. At 740 pm CST on the 10th, a tornado (rated EF2) was spawned southwest of Midway (Logan County). The tornado cut close to a fourteen mile path before dissipating northeast of Scranton (Logan County).||Nine other mostly weak tornadoes (eight rated EF1/one rated EF2) were confirmed across the state through the wee hours of the 11th. Two of these tornadoes were in the Little Rock County Warning Area near Seaton (Lonoke County) and Jerome (Drew County). The former tornado blew in a grain bin and tossed a shed into nearby trees. The latter tornado mangled a silo. Trees were uprooted or snapped, and utility poles were taken out.||A few places reported sleet or snow on the back side of the system.","Sleet mixed with rain at Marshall.","CSV"

Winds then picked up from the northwest, with peak wind gusts during the morning of January 18 reaching 47 mph at Le Mars.

Heavy rainfall, flooding, isolated damaging winds, a couple tornadoes, and gusty non-thunderstorm winds impacted southeast Missouri during this time. The bulk of the event occurred overnight and into the morning hours on the 11th. Rainfall totals ranged from 2 to 5 inches, which resulted in isolated flash flooding. The most significant tornado occurred in the Jackson area, which was rated EF-2. Strong to severe convection over the Ozark Mountains moved east into an environment of very strong wind shear over southeast Missouri, with 850 mb winds near 60 knots. The convection maintained intensity after it crossed the Mississippi River during the early morning hours. Tremendous wind shear (winds of 50 knots down to 1500 feet above ground level) and strong forcing associated with a potent 500 mb shortwave compensated for weak instability. Some of the strong low-level winds reached the surface in the form of gradient wind gusts to around 40 mph. A weak surface low formed along a cold front over southwest Arkansas, then deepened as it tracked northeast across the Missouri Bootheel and into the lower Ohio Valley on the morning of the 11th.","A large portion of the roof was blown off a big wooden barn.

Some fallen trees landed on homes. Wind recording equipment measured a 74 mph gust at Fargo (Monroe County), and a 71 mph gust at the University of Arkansas at Monticello (Drew County).||There were also isolated tornadoes. At 740 pm CST on the 10th, a tornado (rated EF2) was spawned southwest of Midway (Logan County). The tornado cut close to a fourteen mile path before dissipating northeast of Scranton (Logan County).||Nine other mostly weak tornadoes (eight rated EF1/one rated EF2) were confirmed across the state through the wee hours of the 11th. Two of these tornadoes were in the Little Rock County Warning Area near Seaton (Lonoke County) and Jerome (Drew County). The former tornado blew in a grain bin and tossed a shed into nearby trees. The latter tornado mangled a silo. Trees were uprooted or snapped, and utility poles were taken out.||A few places reported sleet or snow on the back side of the system.","Part of a grain bin was blown in. Several power poles were snapped. A house sustained roof damage. A storage shed set into the ground with concrete was blown up and out of the ground about 100 feet. It ended up in several large trees and was completely destroyed. Part of the roof of a metal barn was peeled back.","CSV"

Moderate to heavy snowfall with south winds from 30 to 40 mph gusting to over 50 mph brought a period of blizzard conditions to northeast South Dakota from the morning to the late afternoon on Friday. By Friday evening, a brief lull in the winds allowed for improvements to the visibility.||A second quick period of snowfall occurred in the late evening and early morning hours with an Arctic cold front coming in from the northwest.  Northwest winds of 30 to 40 mph gusting to over 50 mph behind the front brought a second round of blizzard conditions from late Friday evening into the early morning hours Saturday. Ground blizzard conditions then continued through much of the day Saturday across northeast South Dakota. Very cold air moved in with the northwest winds as well.||Impacts included road closures such as I-29 across all of eastern SD from Friday evening through the afternoon Saturday. Portions of I-90 were also closed with other roads closed for even longer. Some power outages occurred along with many vehicles in ditches. On Friday, many schools were closed with nearly all activities canceled or postponed for the weekend. The governor closed state branch executive offices for Friday afternoon. ||Snowfall amounts ranged from 1 to 6 inches from the Missouri River east through northeast South Dakota. The highest amounts included, 3 inches at Sisseton, Webster, Aberdeen, and Clear Lake; 4 inches at Eureka, Bowdle, and Faulkton; 5 inches at Clark, Roy Lake, and Castlewood; and 6 inches at Summit, Milbank, and 3 miles east of Watertown.","","CSV"

The cold, westerly flow behind the front transitioned widespread showers to lake effect snow showers east of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Lake temperatures averaged in the upper 30s to low 40s during this event with no ice present, which allowed some warmer surface air to make its way into the lower terrain east of the lakes, limiting accumulation there.

A strong southerly return flow commenced out ahead of the trough during the 8th-9th, allowing for unseasonably warm and humid conditions to advance northward across Southern Oklahoma, much of Central and Eastern Texas, as well as Louisiana, Arkansas, and the Lower Mississippi Valley. Meanwhile, an intensifying surface low pressure system and associated dry line developed along the Red River of North Texas into Southern Oklahoma during the afternoon hours, which spread east northeast across the Ark-La-Tex during the early morning hours on January 11th. With afternoon temperatures climbing into the mid 70s ahead of this trough, moderate instability developed across the broad warm sector, with very strong wind shear in place as large scale forcing increased ahead of the trough axis across East Texas, Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, and North Louisiana. Thus, an axis of strong to severe showers and thunderstorms developed during the evening hours across Southeast Oklahoma, adjacent sections of Southwest Arkansas and East Texas, which advanced east into North Louisiana during the early morning hours of the 11th. Widespread damaging winds downed trees and power lines across much of Northwest and Northcentral Louisiana, with even a long track tornado developing along the line of severe thunderstorms across Central Bossier, Southern Webster, and Southern Claiborne Parishes. Another isolated tornado touched down in Western Union Parish, before these storms exited the region shortly before daybreak on the 11th. Unfortunately, these storms resulted in four fatalities  across Northwest Louisiana, three of which occurred from the Haughton tornado.","A damage survey confirmed that a confined area of straight line winds caused scattered property and tree damage just south of Benton.

The seiche peaked the water level in Buffalo at 9.85 feet above low water datum.","","CSV"

Along Ashley 470 Road, heavy tree damage was noted along with several power lines down. Some homes had minor roof damage here as well as along Ashley 471 Road. Uprooted and snapped trees continued along the path. As the the tornado crossed Highway 189, a strong surge was noted on the north side of the path where a focused corridor of trees were damaged.
