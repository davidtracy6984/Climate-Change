How is Climate Change, and Human activity affecting our Fresh Water?
Fresh Water Security/Insecurity
Describe the core message or hypothesis for your project.
Climate change, the resulting droughts, industry, increasing population and lack of care of this resource is putting our 
limited freshwater resource at risk. Our legal efforts to correct this are at times failing due to politics in the United States.
Progress towards alternatives has be undertaken and is improving our outlook for future fresh water needs at a reasonable cost, 
with low impact to the environment.

Describe the questions you and your group found interesting, and what motivated you to answer them
                               What’s going on with the Great Lakes?
Why ask?    It’s the largest single fresh water source in the country.
                       What is the impact on a major river, the Colorado for instance?
Why ask?     -Does increased population (and in turn, increased water needs) result in a measurable impact on Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the Western U.S fed directly by the Colorado River.
                       What is the effect on the Mt. Hood Glacier?
Why ask?     It’s close to home for us, we wanted to know.
                       Are there Laws to protect Fresh Water?
Why ask?     What is the Local, State and Federal Governments doing?
                       What’s the status of our fresh water today?
Why ask?     We need to know if we are safe or at risk.
                       What are the alternatives to our current resource of Fresh Water?
Why ask?     Does technology have an answer?
 
 
 Conclusively, freshwater is a vital resource that we all need/use to exist, and the physical impacts of humanity is applying large 
 stress of the system. Through the data we have found that each part of the freshwater system, the lakes, rivers, glaciers, and 
 groundwater are showing signs of decline; either by removal from the system, chemical pollution, and/or environmental impacts 
 such as climate change have taken a toll that needs to be addressed before it is too late. We have focused the narrative on how 
 to fix the problem, we need to limit or put a stop to emissions/pollutions incline, and relief from overuse of each particular 
 system before it is too late, or we end up having to rely on non-cost-effective measures and inefficient energy use for 
 desalination of seawater.
